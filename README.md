# Group Project 1 Rain or Shine
For our project, our team has created a website to help cure boredom. When the user inputs their address, they are displayed their local weather and a list of activities they can do. If they don't like any of the options, they can reshuffle the list. When the user wants to enter a new address, they can click the "Enter New Zip Code" button to take them back to the landing page and re-enter. 

# Why
We wanted an app that helps the user find ideas to do when they have none. Boredom sucks, and hopefully we can help provide the user with something that fits their needs. Whether they want to relax, find something productive, or just enjoy a new hobby they can come here to get a start on it.

# The Process
After our team got the idea, we began with a wireframe to see how we would want the page to be set up. This went immediately into two teams that focused on each of our strengths, one back end and one front end. We started listing bite sized tasks into our repo issues and went to work. We started with the basic HTML, adding Materialize and jQuery into their needed tags. With that done, front end started with the layout. Making sure we class and id what our back end team needed to, we added the rows, columns, and elements to the page. Then our back end team got to work setting up the Openweather and Bored API and getting them to dynamically populate the divs we needed them to. Inbetween them doing that, front end continually updated stylings and fixed issues that came up with populated areas. Final process was checking for errors and syntax and making sure everything functioned on the deployed site.
